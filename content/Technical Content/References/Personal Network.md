I use [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) as a VPN to manage my personal network. The units part of this environment are:
1. [[Tachyon]]
2. [[Maelstrom]]
3. [[Typhoon]]
4. [[Ion]]
5. [[Positron]]

Tailscale allows me to:
1. Avoid the hassle of setting up port forwarding with a router and allows my devices to be very mobile. This is important as I move every 4 months and the only stationary device I have is [[Typhoon]]. 
2. Expose certain services like [NTFY](https://ntfy.sh/) to the web so that devices not part of the network (or devices not currently using the VPN) can interact with them.
3. Do it all for free ðŸ˜Ž.
