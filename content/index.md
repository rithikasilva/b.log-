Welcome to my blog and digital garden, where I store some thoughts and ideas. This is essentially a place for me to keep track of the things that interest me. While primarily intended for my own use, feel free to peruse it at your leisure. 

On desktop, a search bar, table of contents, and graph view are found to the left while the explorer is on the right.

On mobile, a search bar can be found above and the explorer at the bottom of each page.
