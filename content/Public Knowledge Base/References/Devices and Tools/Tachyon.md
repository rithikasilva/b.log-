**February 2024 Update**:
As of January 2024, I, along with many other G14 users, started to experience seemingly random BSODs while using the device on battery. I've tried every software solution I can think of, and others have sent in their devices under RMA, yet it appears that no one has had the issue resolved. The BSODs do not appear when the device is plugged in, nor do any crashes occur while using another operating system. I'll be keeping an eye out to see if any patches are released, but I doubt it, considering there have been users experiencing this since mid-2023. For the foreseeable future, I'll be using Fedora for my daily tasks, except for gaming. Fortunately, this isn't so bad, as there is a strong Linux community for the G14, and Fedora provides excellent support for AMD CPU + GPU machines.
