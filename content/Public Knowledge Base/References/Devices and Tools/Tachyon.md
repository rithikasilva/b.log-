**February 2024 Update**:
As of January 2024, I along with many other G14 users started to get seemingly random BSODs while using the device on battery. I've tried everything software I can, and other have sent in their device under RMA, and it appears no one has gotten the issue solved. The BSODs do no appear on power, nor do any crashes appear while using another OS. I'll be keeping an eye out to see if some patch comes along, but I doubt it since there are users who had this since mid 2023. For the foreseeable future, I'll be daily driving Fedora for everything but gaming. This isn't so bad as there is a strong Linux community for the G14 and Fedora has great support for AMD CPU + GPU machines.
