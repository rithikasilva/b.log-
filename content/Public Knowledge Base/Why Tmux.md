### *WIP*

What does it do/solve for me?
- No new windows/instances of the same terminal. 
	- Tabbing interacts with other programs.
		- Rebind for Vim style navigation.
	- Often just require a quick shell to go and check something/run something.
- Allow you to disconnect and reconnect to sessions:
	- Working on my server from my phone and I get disconnected -> if was in Tmux session means nothing is lost.
- Status bar has information
	- Can add whatever I want -> what is on your systems status bar? -> time + date
