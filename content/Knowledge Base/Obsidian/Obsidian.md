**Why Obsidian?**
- I used to use Notion. It was great but Obsidian:
	- Has locally stored notes with the option for remote back up. Avoid the issue if being locked out of my own notes with Notion.
	- Has Canvas feature is underrated for people like me who like to visually lay things out.
	- Has more plugins than I ever need (and is easy enough to write custom plugins for).
	- Is completely free.
	- Was written by UW grads ðŸ˜Ž.

**Why not Obsidian?**
- There is always something different that I could be doing to use it better. This seems like a good thing but this means that I spend more time "learning" the tools than using them sometimes ðŸ˜“.
