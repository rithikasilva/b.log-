Liberty is a White ROG Falchion Ace with blank black keycaps and a Glorious Coiled Cable. It has brown switches. The current state of Liberty looks a little different than the photo above, namely that the backspace and slash key have been replaced by other black keys (the photo was taken while I was at school and didn't have extra keycaps).
