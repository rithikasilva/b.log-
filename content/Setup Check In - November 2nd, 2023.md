I haven't done a check in for my current work/school/play setup in a while, so I thought it was about time.

## Computing Devices Overview

### Tachyon

Tachyon is an ASUS ROG Zephyrus G14 (2022) with a Ryzen 9 6900HS, Radeon RX 6700S,  and 16 GB of RAM. It is my daily driver machine (after the forfeiting of Photon - my old DELL G3 - to my younger brother), and I haven't had any problems with it. It's given my the flexibility of 10+ hours of battery life (with reasonable performance) while still being graphically sound for gaming purposes. Having the option to disable the dGPU is something I wish more laptops had.

Tachyon currently runs Windows 11, Kali and Ubuntu in WSL2 (for testing and development respectively), and Ubuntu as a dual boot. Making Tachyon dual boot Ubuntu was an attempt to get me to shift all of my development work to Linux, but the convenience of WSL2 + Windows has been keeping me there. After all, I don't need much else than a terminal for what I work on.
