I haven't done a check in for my current work/school/play setup in a while, so I thought it was about time.

## Core Devices

### Tachyon
Tachyon is an ASUS ROG Zephyrus G14 (2022) with a Ryzen 9 6900HS, Radeon RX 6700S,  and 16 GB of RAM. It is my daily driver machine (after the forfeiting of Photon - my old DELL G3 - to my younger brother), and I haven't had any problems with it. It's given my the flexibility of 10+ hours of battery life (with reasonable performance) while still being graphically sound for gaming purposes. Having the option to disable the dGPU is something I wish more laptops had.

Tachyon currently runs Windows 11, Kali and Ubuntu in WSL2 (for testing and development respectively), and Ubuntu as a dual boot. Making Tachyon dual boot Ubuntu was an attempt to get me to shift all of my development work to Linux, but the convenience of WSL2 + Windows has been keeping me there. After all, I don't need much else than a terminal for what I work on.

### Positron
Positron is my 3rd Gen M1 iPad Pro (11 inch) with 128 GB of storage. I use this with a Logitech Folio Combo Touch (for when I want a keyboard but don't want to use/bring Tachyon) and an Apple Pen Gen 2 to write Math notes and do practice questions. To make the writing experience nicer, I use a generic matte screen protector I brought of off Amazon.

Positron had more use when I was using Photon, as I would leave Photon at home because of it's abysmal battery life and do all my work on campus with Positron. Since getting Tachyon, I tend to only use Positron for things I want to write instead of type.

### Ion
Ion is my iPhone X. I've had Ion since 9th grade, and it hasn't failed me yet. However, I think it's about time to upgrade since Ion can heat up sometimes and it'll stop getting software updates next year. As much as I would like to swap to android, having and iPad and having my family all use Apple devices makes buying another iPhone be the most convenience decision.

### Typhoon
Typhoon is an old Dell Optiplex 360 my family had used as a home computer. It has a Pentium 35200 and 4 GB of RAM. Over the summer, I turned it into a small homelab/server by installing Ubuntu server on it. Since then, I haven't done much with, mostly due to a lack of inspiration and time. As of right now, the plan is to play with hosting a personal music service or my personal site on it. Maybe using it for GitHub Actions that I use. We will see.

## Other Devices and Accessories
The other devices and accessories I use are pretty self explanatory:
- A Sony ZV-E10 with a Gorilla Pod 3K for Photos/Videos. 
- The Sony WH-1000XM4 for audio.
- A Razer Basilisk mouse and Steel Series mousepad.
- Liberty - My current keyboard. The base is a ROG Falchion Ace in white with custom empty black key caps and a Glorious coiled cable in black. Liberty was put together from the guts of Graviton, which used a white RK64 as a base. (*Show below for reference, and because I'm happy about it ðŸ˜€*)
- A Timex Expedition Field Chronograph for my watch. I had the brown bands replaced with black bands because the brown ones broke ðŸ˜”.
