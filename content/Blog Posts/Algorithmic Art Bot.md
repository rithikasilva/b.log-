Jean the Agorithmic Art Bot is online! Besides automated posting (which I'm having trouble finding methods for while still keeping the code on replit), all initial features are online. You can find the code on [my GitHub](https://github.com/rithikasilva).

The algorithms used include: image colour inversion, rotating squares within the image, displacing squares within the image, pixel sorting, and combinations of the previous algorithms. Due to the nature of the project, I plan on adding algorithms overtime in order to achieve more interesting results.

Currently, images are sourced from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) using their API (particularly, images of the sky and clouds) and the code requires me to run it.

You can find the results [@Jean_Art_Bot](https://twitter.com/Jean_Art_Bot).
