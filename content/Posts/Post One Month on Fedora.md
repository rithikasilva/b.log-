I've officially been using Fedora for a month on [[Tachyon]] and I have enough changes made that I think it's time for me to do a progress post.

At a glance, I'm using:
- [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) as my terminal emulator.
	- Bash as my shell.
	- [Starship](https://github.com/starship/starship) for my prompt.
	- Tmux as default.
- [Dunst](https://github.com/dunst-project/dunst) for desktop notifications.
- [i3](https://github.com/i3/i3) as my WM.
- [Picom](https://github.com/yshui/picom) as my compositor.
- [Rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) as my app/script launcher.
- [Polybar](https://github.com/polybar/polybar) as my bar.
- [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin) Mocha as my theme for everything.
- I use both NVIM and VSCode for my editors.
- [auto-cpufreq](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq) to increase my battery life.
The details of what I'm using right now can be found in my [dotfiles repo](https://github.com/rithikasilva/.dotfiles).
