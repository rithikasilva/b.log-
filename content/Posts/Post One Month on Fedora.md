I've officially been using Fedora for a month on [[Tachyon]] and I have enough changes made that I think it's time for me to do a progress-post.

At a glance, I'm using:
- Alacritty as my terminal emulator.
	- Bash as my shell.
	- Starship for my prompt.
	- Tmux as default.
- Dunst for desktop notifications.
- i3 as my WM.
- Picom as my compositor.
- Rofi as my app/script launcher.
- Polybar as my bar.
- Catppuccin Mocha as my theme for everything.
- I use both NVIM and VSCode for my editors.
The details of what I'm using right now can be found in my [dotfiles repo](https://github.com/rithikasilva/.dotfiles).
